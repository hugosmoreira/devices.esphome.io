//
// A PR is only taken out of draft if the bot put it there (see mfe-intake.cjs),
// so an author's own work-in-progress draft is left alone.
//
// Runs from two jobs in made-for-esphome-pr.yml: after the Made for ESPHome
// review (the slowest check by a wide margin, it compiles the linked config,
// so the rest have settled by then), and again after CI, which covers CI
// finishing later or a failed CI job being re-run. Either way all it needs
// from the run is the PR number, read from `pr-number.txt` in whichever
// artifact that job downloaded (`mfe-review-report` or `validation-report`).
// Everything else is re-derived from the check runs, so the review verdict
// needs no plumbing: a failed review is simply a failed check.
//
// Exported as a function so it can be linted (`node --check`) and unit-tested
// with a mocked GitHub client.
